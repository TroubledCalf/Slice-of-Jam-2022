    "What are you doing? You've been kidnapped. You really shouldn't be so chummy with someone keeping you here against your will."
    "However."
    "It's hard to deny, though, the way their attitude has changed based on your compliance."
    "Books and coffee, and even offering to show you another room in the house."
    "Even if you don't like it, they are nice gestures."
    "Perhaps you can gain something actually nice if you continue to play along?"
    "Are you listening?"

    v "Finally, I'll have access to a real bathroom. About time."
    "Something I can agree on."

    "Admittedly not a high bar."
